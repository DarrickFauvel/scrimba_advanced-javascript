Challenge: Refactor the Library System Code.

You are working with a piece of code that handles
information about books in a library system. The
current code is functional but can be improved to
be more concise and efficient by using short-circuiting,
nullish coalescing, and Optional Chaining.

The existing code performs the following tasks:

- Pushes an object with title, author, year published,
  and availability to an array 'collection'
- Provides default values for missing information.
